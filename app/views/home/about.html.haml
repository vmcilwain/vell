      %p I'm a seasoned Ruby and Ruby on Rails developer currently working for ASPPH as a Web Specialist mainly in Ruby and Ruby on Rails. Prior to that, I was a Senior Systems and Database administrator for OPNET / Riverbed Technologies where I also did Ruby and Ruby on Rails development.
      
      %p I received my BS in Information Technology in 2012; graduating with a 3.78 GP. By the time I finished getting my BA, I had already been successful in my career in Information Technology. The reason for my success prior to getting my BA (and even after) was my ability to take on any challenge and adapt to changes while remaining humble to new experiences. These abilities allowed for me to be the "go to" guy for important task that helped move the business forward.
      
      %p The value that I provide as a Ruby and Ruby on Rails developer is the ability to turn around a well tested product in a respectable amount of time. This allows for early feedback and collaboration among the stakeholders and myself. Thats a good thing! In addition to that, my previous years of knowledge as a Systems and Database administrator in the corporate environment gives me a level of understanding in how the application and systems work together.
      
      %p I pride myself on learning new technologies when it makes sense and when I have the time. Here is a brief list of the technologies that I work with:
